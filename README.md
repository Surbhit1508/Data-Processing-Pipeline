# Enterprise Data Processing Pipeline

## Overview
This data processing pipeline is designed to efficiently handle and transform 200+ daily records with high accuracy and improved processing speed. The system implements parallel processing, robust error handling, and comprehensive data validation to ensure reliable data processing operations.

## Features
The pipeline offers several key capabilities:
- Parallel data processing using Python multiprocessing
- Comprehensive data validation and quality checks
- Automated error handling and retry mechanisms
- Detailed logging and monitoring
- PostgreSQL integration for efficient data storage
- Configurable processing rules and business logic

## Technical Architecture
The system is built using a modular architecture with the following components:

**Data Ingestion Layer**
- Scheduled data collection using Apache Airflow
- Input validation and format verification
- Initial data quality assessment

**Processing Engine**
- Parallel processing implementation
- Data transformation and cleaning
- Business rule application
- Error handling and logging

**Storage Layer**
- PostgreSQL database integration
- Optimized indexing and partitioning
- Backup management
- Data retrieval interfaces

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- PostgreSQL 12+
- Required Python packages:
  ```
  pandas==1.5.3
  psycopg2-binary==2.9.5
  python-dotenv==0.21.1
  logging==0.5.1.2
  ```

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/data-pipeline.git
   cd data-pipeline
   ```

2. Create and activate virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # Unix
   venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Configure environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your database credentials and configurations
   ```

## Usage
To run the pipeline:

```python
from data_pipeline import DataPipeline

pipeline = DataPipeline()
success = pipeline.run_pipeline('input_data.csv')
```

## Configuration
Key configurations in `.env`:
```
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_NAME=your_database
DB_USER=your_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
CHUNK_SIZE=50
PARALLEL_PROCESSES=4
```

## Monitoring and Maintenance
The pipeline includes comprehensive logging and monitoring:
- Process logs: `logs/pipeline_YYYYMMDD.log`
- Error tracking: `logs/errors_YYYYMMDD.log`
- Performance metrics: Available through Grafana dashboard

## Performance Metrics
- Processing Speed: 40% improvement over sequential processing
- Data Accuracy: Maintains 95% accuracy rate
- Daily Capacity: Successfully handles 200+ records
- Error Rate: Less than 5% with automated retry mechanism
